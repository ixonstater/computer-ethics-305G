        <h1>Frustrations With Masks</h1>
<pre>
        Citation: https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/08/27/provo-city-council/

    I have heard a lot of different opinions, and what people call facts, regarding the necessity of wearing a mask these days, but the difficulty of
distinguishing between Covid facts and Covid opinions is not what I am frustrated about.  It's also not the stark differences in those opinions, or even
the lengths that some individuals go to make their opinions heard.  The frustrating thing is the inconsistencies that I see in government policy regarding the
issue.  I honestly feel that the Provo City Council's mandate forcing people to wear masks in public venues this last week was shortsighted and contrary to
the people's will.  Its just hard to believe that five months after Covid-19 hit masks are suddenly crucial to public health and safety (I say five months as 
March is the first month I remember being seriously affected by the virus here in Provo).  Why was this legislation so unimportant that it only just became
relevant?  During the course of these last five months I have seen so many of my friends and neighbors go out of their way, of their own free will, to help keep
people safe and healthy.  It is so frustrating to feel that the City Council doesn't respect the decisions and freedoms of the people who elected them.
