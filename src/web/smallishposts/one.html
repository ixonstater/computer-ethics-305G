        <h1>Transitioning From 3OI to 2OI</h1>
<pre>
    Stepping from 3OI to 2OI (unlike 2OI to 1OI or 1OI to 0OI) is not a discrete event; it is rather a continuous process. This process is a person
ignorant of the answer, ignorant of the question and ignorant of the process of discovering the question, testing, poking and prying around in the dark.
The supplicant of knowledge enshrouded in the Third Order of Ignorance is acting on an invaluable truth: that confronted with a complete lack of knowledge
a learner must do something, anything and observe carefully the result of their action.  As an example, I once had to refactor an existing codebase in an
attempt to eliminate some bugs.  At the beginning I knew that I was ignorant, but I did not know what questions would arise or even how to cause those
questions to arise.  So I started pressing, I asked as many question as I could, I read each line of code, and I executed pieces of the codebase in a
limited setting.  Slowly questions started to arise, and answers inevitably followed, but from the beginning all that I had was the trust that prying 
around the issue would grant me knowledge.
