        <h1>What is the Value of Creativity?</h1>
<pre>
    If our world's education systems are passively (or actively) eradicating artistic creativity, why should we care?  I know that without creativity 
many of the advances in technology that enable me to do my job and support my family would not exist.  I also know that without the artistic creations
of our society my life would be a great deal more drab. But I'm not convinced that the right way to nurture creativity is to neuter mathematics and 
language in public education.  I think we have to question whether creativity is a skill all its own, or is individual to the skills wherein it manifests.
For example, I am creative in the code that I write, but not in the music I play; I am creative in the amateur rockets I build, but not in the painting 
that I enjoy doing with my wife.  If creativity is partial to individual pursuits, then what is the value of forcing the education system to rebuild 
itself around drama and dance?  Has our world really advanced far enough from the circumstances that put mathematics and language in their hallowed
places that we can spare educative resources for the arts?
